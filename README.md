# Language of Problem Solving

***Usage:***

The file main_script.py contains the functions to generate all main figures in the paper: "Problem-Solving as a Language: A Computational Lens into Human and Monkey Intelligence". 

main_script.py is divided into several sections:

1) Implement LoPS grammar induction algorithm by executing the generate_data function.

2) Execute the generate_img_data function to generate the data required for visulization.

3) Execute the draw_img function to generate all the figures in the paper.

As illustrated in the Algorithm 1 in the paper draft, to induce the structure of the Language of Problem-Solving (LoPS) from each subjectâ€™s behavioral data, we tackle this inverse problem in three steps: Feature extraction, Strategy fitting, and Grammar induction.

The FeatureExtractor file generates task-relevant information, such as game state information, reward information and joystick action events.

The BasicStrategy file includes functions to fit the strategy weights, and generating strategy sequences. These functions are called through the generate_data function in main_script.py

The GramarInduction file performs grammar induction based on the strategy and game state sequence generated by the above files, and calculates the LoPS complexity from each participant's game-play.

The DrawImg file lincludes generate_data  and plot_code. Generate_data is used to generate the data required for visualization, and plot_code contains the main code for generating figures listed in the paper.

The PGM file contains functions for structure learning algorithms.

We provide two examplar data files required to run the code.
